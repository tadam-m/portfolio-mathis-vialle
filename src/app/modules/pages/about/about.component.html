            Hi I am Mathis Vialle,<br>
            I am currently studying for a Master's degree in Computer Science at Epitech Paris. In 2023, I will obtain a Master's
            degree in Computer Science and Information Technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            During my program at Epitech, I had the opportunity to take on many programming challenges, which improved my
            research and problem-solving skills.
            Most of my assignments were group projects, so I also developed my communication and teamwork skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            My work experiences at Capgemini and 3DS Outscale were great opportunities to apply my knowledge and develop my
            skills in software and web development, given the different tasks I was given. I was able to discover the cloud
            computing environment, the infrastructure environment and the multiple services and constraints that a large
            international company faces.
          </p>
          <p>
            I worked with different professionals, such as web developers, internal storage teams, security teams, private
            Docker teams and management, in English and French.
